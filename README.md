# CNN-foodwaste
We're developing a project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify and classify types of food in the DKU canteen. The model will also include an estimation of food waste by comparing before and after meal images.
Currently being implemented in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joshmanto/food-waste-detection
